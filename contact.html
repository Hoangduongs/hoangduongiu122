        â€œThe special feature of this steak dish is the use of a typical Vietnamese dipping sauce. The dipping sauce is made from fish sauce, brown sugar, garlic, fresh lemon and red chili. It is used as an ingredient to season food.
        
        You can use the dipping sauce to pour over cucumber, radish and tomato salad. The dipping sauce is used in salads or displayed on rice trays or noodles to dip dishes," NYT describes Vietnamese dipping sauce.
